# CS0447.P2

This is a processor designed to work with a fake assembly language called JrMips(created by Jarrett Billingsley). This processor can have instructions loaded into the ROM component used for instruction memory and the RAM component used for data memory. There are mutliple instructions included, each containing a .asm file and .rom/.ram as needed. The .asm files can used to trace the instructions as they execute.
